      <h4>
        - It aint pokemon go. dont just break up with your partner to go get a
        new partner within a hour
      </h4>
      <h4>
        - Dont start flirting with someone who just broke up. like bitch, stop
        being a whore
      </h4>
      <h4>- use ur brain(if u got one lol)</h4>
      <h4>
        - Don't flirt with other people whilst in a online relationship, just
        because it's online it doesnt mean that it isnt an actual relationship.
      </h4>
      <h4>
        - dont date someone after you met them for 30m. like bro they could be
        some 40 year old whore. learn shit about em first
      </h4>
      <h4>
        - fr talk to the person in voice. like online is already fucking
        horiable, at least try to talk to them in one method
      </h4>
      <h4>
        - Don't send nudes over discord, use something that prevents you from
        screenshotting shit so that ur cock/pussy/tits thing doesn t get leaked
        to the world.
      </h4>
      <h4>
        - if u know someone is in a relationship, dont flirt with them. this is
        a little off topic but still. bro theres so many other whores you can
        send your dick too or rp with. why the single person whos in a
        relationship. this goes back to the use your brain topic !
      </h4>
      <h4>
        - dont randomly say u love a friend if u havent spoke to them in months
      </h4>
